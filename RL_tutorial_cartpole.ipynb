    "So what is the point of this loss function? Well, let's say that we are looking at one single frame of a session, where we think the chosen action led to a high reward, such that rw is positive and large. We want to reinforce the selected action, to make it more probable to occur in the future. So we want y_pred to closer match y_true (increasing its probability), and we tell our model to make it so by changing its parameters to minimize this loss. Ultimately, this is just a fancy optimization task. This loss function is computed for every frame of every section, each with its own action, observation, and discounted reward. That's a lot of data to use to improve!"
