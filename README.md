# simple_rl
Just some entry-level projects in reinforcement learning using open-ai gym.

This code was developed completely independently without reference to tutorials. As a result, it may not be entirely stable.

To run the cartpole script, pip install the tensorflow, scipy, and gym dependencies in a virtual environment and call 

`python cartpole.py`
